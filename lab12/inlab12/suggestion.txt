I have one suggestion that I think would help students, like me, a lot, which is recording the video lectures with a microphone. Every video lecture is recorded with the default microphone on the classroom desktop and Bloomfield likes to move around a lot. The sound quality is good when he is near the desktop and very bad when he walks away. I think a microphone would help make the video lectures easier to watch.
